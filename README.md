### Prerequisites
Before running any of the implementations, make sure you have the required environment set up for the specific programming language. Each implementation folder contains its own set of instructions on how to run or compile the code.

### Contents
1. Binary_Search: Implementation of the binary search algorithm.
2. Bubble_Sort: Implementation of the bubble sort algorithm.
3. Insertion_Sort: Implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
4. Linear_Search: Implementation of the linear search algorithm.
   
### Usage
Each algorithm has its own folder containing the implementation code. You can navigate to the respective folder to view the code and understand how the algorithm works.

### Contributing
Contributions to this repository are always welcome. If you would like to add a new solution or improve an existing one, feel free to submit a pull request. Please ensure that the code adheres to the repository's coding standards.

### License
This repository is to train myself on implementing some of the Algorithms using C. Feel free to use and modify the code as per your requirements.
